ALABAMA NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most of present-day Alabama was part of Georgia until the south-central part was included in Mississippi Territory, whose establishment was authorized by Congress in 1798 and agreed to by Georgia in 1802.  In 1804, Mississippi Territory was expanded to include the rest of Alabama except for the Gulf Coast portion, which was added in 1812 although still in dispute with Spain until 1819.  Alabama became a territory in 1817, and was admitted as a State on December 14, 1819 with substantially its present boundaries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Census coverage of Alabama began in 1800, included much of the State by 1820, and added the rest by 1840.  The totals for 1800 and 1810 are for areas then in Mississippi Territory. In 1820 the official State total (127,901) did not include the population (16,416) of three counties whose census returns only arrived in Washington in 1822.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Populations for 1800 and 1810 are totals of those counties of Mississippi Territory entirely or mostly within present-day Alabama. Population for 1820 excludes three counties, Lawrence (8,652), Perry (4,118), and Washington (3,646), whose returns were received too late for inclusion in the official State total.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ALASKA NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867, with essentially its present boundaries.  It was made a territory in 1912 and admitted as a State on January 3, 1959.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Census coverage of Alaska began in 1880.  For the censuses of 1930 and 1940, Alaska actually was enumerated in the fall of the preceding year  (1929, 1939).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Alaska has no counties; the names, boundaries, and designations of the subdivisions reported in the census have evolved considerably over recent decades.  In 1990 and 1980, most of the population of the State lived in entities designated as Boroughs; the remainder was reported by Census Areas (sometimes abbreviated C.A.).  In 1970, the census was reported by Census Divisions, some of which corresponded to boroughs.  In 1960, the census was reported by 24 Election Districts.  The table in Part III lists areas that existed in 1990 with their 1990 names and designations. In both the table and the notes, areas listed without any designation had ceased to exist by 1990, when all areas were either Boroughs or Census Areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 2: For areas that existed in 1960, 1970, or 1980 but not in 1990, the notes specify the areas of which they became part.  (Small portions may have come from or gone to other areas not specified.)  No designations appear in the table for these extinguished areas; in 1980 they were Census Areas, in 1970 Census Divisions, and in 1960 Election Districts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 3: Aleutians East Borough: formed from Aleutian Islands (now Aleutians West) Census Area (1987). 1980 pop. in 1990 area: 1,643.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 4: Aleutians West Census Area: in 1960-80, Aleutian Islands.  1980 pop. in 1990 area: 6,125.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 5: Dillingham Census Area: in 1960-70, Bristol Bay (Census Division). 1970 pop. in 1980 area: 3,872; 1980 pop. in 1990 area: 3,232.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 6: Lake and Peninsula Borough: formed from Dillingham Census Area (1989). 1980 pop. in 1990 area: 1,384.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 7: North Slope Borough: formed 1972, from Barrow, Upper Yukon, and Kobuk (Northwest Arctic).  Populations shown for 1960-70 are for Barrow. 1970 pop. in 1980 area: 3,451.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 8A: Northwest Arctic Borough: formed 1986, primarily from Kobuk Census Area. Populations shown for 1960-80 are for Kobuk.  1970 pop. in 1980 area: 4,048; 1980 pop. in 1990 area: 4,831.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 8B: Valdez-Cordova Census Area: in 1960-70, Valdez-Chitina-Whittier. 1970 pop. in 1980 area: 4,977.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 9: For 1910 through 1950, Alaska Territory was reported by four Judicial Divisions.  These corresponded to the areas listed in the table approximately as follows (names are shortened in some cases):",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"   First Judicial Division: Angoon, Haines, Juneau, Ketchikan, Lynn Canal, Outer Ketchikan, Prince of Wales, Sitka, Skagway, and Wrangell.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"   Second Judicial Division: Barrow, Nome, North Slope, Northwest Arctic, and Wade Hampton.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"   Third Judicial Division: Aleutians (East and West), Anchorage, Bristol  Bay, Dillingham, Cordova, Kenai, Kodiak, Lake and Peninsula, ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"   Matanuska, Seward, and Valdez.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"   Fourth Judicial Division: Bethel, Fairbanks, Kuskokwim, Southeast  Fairbanks, Upper Yukon, and Yukon-Koyukuk.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 10: In 1880, 1890, and 1900, Alaska was reported by two Districts.  The Northern District corresponded roughly to Judicial Divisions 2 and 4 of 1910, and the Southern District corresponded roughly to Judicial Divisions 1 and 3 of 1910 (see note 9).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ARKANSAS NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Arkansas was acquired as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and was included in Louisiana Territory, established in 1805 and comprising the whole of the Louisiana Purchase north of present-day Louisiana.  Arkansas (then spelled Arkansaw) became a territory in 1819 and at first included most of present-day Oklahoma; in 1828 it reached essentially its present boundaries, although the boundary with Texas was incorrectly interpreted at that time.  Arkansas was admitted as a State on June 15, 1836. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1810, census coverage of Louisiana Territory was limited to portions of present-day Arkansas and Missouri, mainly close to the Mississippi River. The 1810 census was reported by districts; the total for 1810 is for Arkansas District, which was entirely within present-day Arkansas.  New Madrid District, which included the northern part of present-day Arkansas, was mainly in Missouri.  In 1820 census coverage included much of the present State and a small number of people in present-day Oklahoma and Texas.  By 1830 census coverage included the whole of Arkansas, and also included (in old Miller County) a portion of today's Texas.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1810 is population of Arkansas District, Louisiana Territory.  Total for 1890 includes 32 Indians in prison, not reported by county.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Note 6: The first Miller County, established in 1820 by Arkansas Territory, included some population within the legal boundaries of Spanish Mexico and some within present-day Oklahoma; in 1830 the area reported as Miller was actually entirely within Mexico (Texas).  By 1840, with the location of boundaries better understood, it no longer existed as an Arkansas county. The present Miller County was created in 1874.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

COLORADO NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although part of Colorado was acquired as early as the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, it had no organized government until 1850, when parts of the present State were included in New Mexico and Utah Territories.  Colorado was established as a territory in 1861 with its present boundaries, from parts of Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Utah Territories.  The 1860 population is the total enumerated within the 1861 boundaries.  Colorado was admitted as a State on August 1, 1876. Present-day Colorado had no census coverage in 1850, and none in 1860 for the portion taken from Utah Territory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The District of Columbia was formed in 1791 from territory ceded by Maryland and Virginia, but remained in some respects under their jurisdiction until the National government moved there in 1800.  The District included the existing small cities of Georgetown and Alexandria as well as the site chosen for the Nation's new capital, Washington.  In 1846 the portion south of the Potomac River, including Alexandria, was retroceded to Virginia.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 1800 the census reported the District as part of Maryland and Virginia. All populations shown in the table exclude the portion returned to Virginia in 1846.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Population for 1800-40 is for the present territory of the District; it excludes Alexandria County, then a part of the District but retroceded to Virginia in 1846 and now comprising Arlington County and much of the city of Alexandria.  Population of the District as then constituted: 1800: 14,093; 1810: 24,023; 1820: 33,039; 1830: 39,834; 1840: 43,712.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 2: The portion of the District ceded by Maryland became Washington County in 1801.  The governmental relationship between the county and Washington and Georgetown cities changed over time; in 1874 all local governments in the District were superseded by a single government established by Congress.  However, from 1810 to 1890 the census regularly was reported in terms of the 3 subdivisions shown for those dates in the table.  From 1900 through 1990, the census has reported the District and the city of Washington as coextensive.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Through 1920, however, the census also specified the populations within the old boundaries of the 3 former subdivisions, as follows: ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GEORGIA NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Georgia was one of the 13 original States.  At the close of the Revolution it included most of present-day Alabama and Mississippi, an area which finally became Mississippi Territory in 1802.  In that year Georgia reached essentially its present boundaries, although survey uncertainties resulted in continuing disputes with bordering States over subsequent decades.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Census coverage in 1790 and 1800 was limited to the eastern portions of the present State near the Savannah River and the Atlantic coast; there was no coverage of present-day Alabama or Mississippi. The population for 1810 excludes 1,026 persons in (old) Walton County, reported as a Georgia county but later determined to be in North Carolina.  Census coverage of the State was relatively complete by 1840.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HAWAII NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hawaii was an independent nation prior to ceding its sovereignty to the United States in 1898; it was made a territory in 1900.  On August 21, 1959, Hawaii was admitted as a State and assumed its present boundaries, omitting certain small islands formerly included in the territory.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Census coverage has included the whole of Hawaii since 1900.  The Hawaiian government conducted at least 9 censuses between 1850 and 1898; see Robert C Schmitt, Historical Statistics of Hawaii (Honolulu: University Press of Hawaii, 1977). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Populations are shown for counties and for inhabited islands.  The 1900 census was reported by islands; counties were first organized in 1905.  The inhabited islands relate to counties as follows: Hawaii County comprises Hawaii; Honolulu County comprises Oahu and certain small islands (see note 2); Kauai County comprises Kauai and Niihau; and Maui County comprises Kahoolawe, Lanai, Maui, and Molokai, except that Kalawao County occupies a small portion of Molokai.  Total for 1940 excludes population (560) of Midway and other small islands reported with Hawaii although not part of the Territory; totals for 1910 through 1930 exclude population of Midway (35 in 1910, 31 in 1920, 36 in 1930).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 2: Honolulu: Honolulu County, officially the City and County of Honolulu, comprises Oahu and the small islands northwest of Kauai and Niihau extending from Nihoa to Kure except for Midway.  Prior to 1959 Palmyra, located about 1000 miles south of the Hawaiian chain, also was included.  Population enumerated on the small northwestern islands is included in the Honolulu County and Oahu island totals (15 in 1960, 31 in 1970, 31 in 1980, zero in 1990; separate data not available for other censuses).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note 3: Kalawao County was reported as part of Maui County in 1930-1950 and in 1970; the data have been adjusted to show it separately at all dates.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ILLINOIS NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Illinois was included in the Northwest Territory established in 1787 and then in Indiana Territory (1800).  Illinois Territory was established in 1809, and included virtually all of present-day Wisconsin and portions of Minnesota and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  Illinois was admitted as a State on December 3, 1818 with essentially its present boundaries.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1790 the Northwest Territory had no census coverage.  The population shown for 1800 is the total of two counties and one community in present-day Illinois, at that time part of Indiana Territory.  Knox County, Indiana Territory, also included some population in what is now Illinois. In 1810, the returns for the two counties of Illinois Territory included some settlements in present-day Wisconsin.  The northern part of the State was not fully covered by the census until 1830.

INDIANA NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Indiana was included in the Northwest Territory (1787) but became a separate territory in 1800.  At that time, in addition to most of present-day Indiana, the Territory included all of Illinois and Wisconsin, the western half of Michigan, and northeastern Minnesota.  In 1802 the boundary with Ohio was altered and eastern Michigan was added, but Michigan Territory was separated in 1805 and Illinois Territory in 1809, leaving Indiana Territory with the present State area except for a narrow band along the northern border; the territory also included a portion of the Michigan Upper Peninsula. On December 11, 1816 Indiana was admitted as a State with essentially its present boundaries.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1790 the Northwest Territory had no census coverage.  The 1800 census of Indiana Territory enumerated scattered communities in southern Indiana, southwestern Illinois, northern Michigan, and Wisconsin; the populations reported from present-day Illinois and Michigan are shown under those States. In addition, Hamilton County, Ohio included some population in what is now Indiana.  In 1810, census coverage of Indiana Territory was limited to southern Indiana, and coverage did not include the whole State until 1830.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1800 comprises Knox County, Indiana Territory, part of which was in present-day Illinois, and the population of two settlements in present-day Wisconsin, Green Bay (50) and Prairie du Chien (65).  The rest of Indiana Territory's 1800 enumerated population (5,641) is shown under Illinois (2,458) and Michigan (551).  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 2: Brown: *Monroe, Bartholomew, Jackson.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note 3: The Gibson-Warrick county boundary differed slightly in 1850 from its alignment in 1830-40 and 1860-1990.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 4: Grant: *Delaware, Cass; Madison.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 5: Union: *Franklin, Wayne, Fayette.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 6: Wabash County (unorganized) was reported in 1820.  Its 1820 area was included in 1830 in Carroll, Warren, Tippecanoe, Clinton, Fountain, Montgomery, Hendricks, Morgan, Monroe, Owen, Parke, Vermillion, and (in small part) Clay.  The present-day Wabash County was formed in 1832.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

KENTUCKY NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kentucky was part of Virginia prior to its admission as a State on June 1, 1792.  It had essentially its present boundaries, except that because of erroneous surveys portions of the Kentucky-Tennessee boundary were in dispute for many years until finally resurveyed in 1859.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Kentucky was reported separately from Virginia in 1790; the county boundaries at that time corresponded to the present-day State lines between Kentucky and Virginia-West Virginia.  Census coverage in 1790 included much of the State's territory, but the area west of the Tennessee River (the Jackson Purchase) was first enumerated in 1820.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

LOUISIANA NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Louisiana west of the Mississippi River was mostly part of the Louisiana Territory, which was ceded by Spain to France in 1803 and then sold by France to the United States.  In 1804 much of the present State was included in the newly established Orleans Territory; the rest of the Louisiana Purchase became Louisiana Territory, renamed Missouri Territory in 1812.  Louisiana was admitted as a State on April 30, 1812 and immediately added the Florida Parishes east of the Mississippi and north of Lake Pontchartrain, although these still were claimed by Spain until 1819. Also in 1819, the boundary with Mexico (Texas) was settled by treaty, bringing the State to essentially its present limits.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1810 the census covered most of the settled parts of what is now Louisiana, except for the Florida Parishes east of the Mississippi River. By 1820 census coverage extended to virtually all of the present State. Louisiana's primary subdivisions have long been termed parishes instead of counties; both terms appear in early censuses.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1810 is for Orleans Territory, and excludes the Florida Parishes east of the Mississippi River.  Total for 1830 includes 210 persons returned in the aggregate rather than by county.  Total for 1890 includes 1 Indian in prison, not reported by parish.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 2: Bienville: Population for 1860 is that published in the 1860 report as ""estimated"".  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MICHIGAN NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Michigan was part of the Northwest Territory established in 1787.  When Indiana Territory was created in 1800 it included the west half of lower Michigan and nearly all of the Upper Peninsula, leaving the remainder of the present State in the Northwest Territory until 1802, when the eastern portion also became part of Indiana Territory.  Michigan Territory was established in 1805, but nearly all the Upper Peninsula remained in Indiana or Illinois Territories. In 1818 Michigan Territory's boundaries were extended to include the rest of the Upper Peninsula and all of present-day Wisconsin and northeastern Minnesota. In 1834 the Territory was expanded still further to stretch to the Missouri River, including the rest of Minnesota, Iowa, and the eastern Dakotas.  Michigan Territory included a northern strip of Indiana until 1816, and it also governed a narrow strip of what is now northwestern Ohio which was claimed by that State. This was ceded to Ohio in 1836, and Michigan was admitted as a State on January 26, 1837 with essentially its present boundaries.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1790 the Northwest Territory had no census coverage.  In 1800 coverage of the present State included only the Detroit area (Wayne County, Northwest Territory) and some persons at ""Machilamackanack,"" Indiana Territory.  Coverage in 1810, 1820, and 1830 expanded in the Lower Peninsula and included population in the strip that was ceded to Ohio in 1836.  The 1820 and 1830 censuses also included some settlements in present-day Wisconsin, shown under that State.  The 1840 census covered all parts of the State.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MINNESOTA NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Northeastern Minnesota, east of the Mississippi River and a line drawn northward from its source to Canada, was part of the Northwest Territory (1787) and later of Indiana Territory (1800), Illinois Territory (1809), Michigan Territory (1818), and Wisconsin Territory (1838).  Most of the rest of the State was part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, and included in Louisiana Territory (1805), renamed Missouri Territory in 1812.  Both these parts of the present State were included in Michigan Territory from 1834 to 1836, and then in Wisconsin Territory until 1838. The portion west of the Mississippi then became part of Iowa Territory, until Minnesota Territory was established in 1849, including the whole present-day State and the Dakotas generally east of the Missouri River. Minnesota was admitted as a State on May 11, 1858 with essentially its present boundaries.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There was only limited census coverage of the present area of the State prior to 1850.  In 1830 a few persons near Lake Superior may have been enumerated in Chippewa County, Michigan Territory; in 1840 some persons in northeastern Minnesota were enumerated in St. Croix County, Wisconsin Territory, and two settlements on the Mississippi River were enumerated as part of Clayton County, Iowa Territory.  In 1850 coverage of Minnesota Territory did not extend beyond the present State except for a few settlers near the Red River in what is now North Dakota.  In 1860 the census covered virtually the whole State.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1850 includes a few settlers near the Red River in what is now North Dakota.  Total for 1890 includes population (8,457) of certain Indian reservations not returned by county.  Total for 1900 includes population (3,486) of White Earth Indian Reservation, not returned by county, and returned in Becker, Clearwater, and Mahnomen Counties in 1910.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note 2: Clearwater: also formed from area separately enumerated as White Earth Indian Reservation in 1900.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note 3: The 1870 census area of old Lac qui Parle County was in Pierce in 1860 and in Swift and Chippewa in 1880.  The current Lac qui Parle County was created in 1871 and does not include any of the earlier Lac qui Parle County.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 4: Mahkahta: to Cass, Otter Tail, Breckinridge (Clay), Becker, Todd, Toombs (Wilkin), Polk.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note 5: Mahnomen: Corresponds to the portion of Norman enumerated in the White Earth Indian Reservation in 1900.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note 6: Norman: The 1900 census boundaries are the same as those of 1910-1990 because of the separate reporting of the White Earth Indian Reservation in 1900.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 7: Pierce: To Big Stone, Stevens, Pope, Chippewa, Lac qui Parle (old); Traverse.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note 8: Pipestone: Present-day Rock County was returned as Pipestone in 1860; present-day Pipestone had no population reported until 1880.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MISSISSIPPI NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most of present-day Mississippi was part of Georgia until the south-central portions of Mississippi and Alabama were established as Mississippi Territory, authorized by Congress in 1798 and agreed to by Georgia in 1802. In 1804, the Territory was expanded to include the northern parts of the two future States.  The Gulf Coast portions were added in 1812, although still in dispute with Spain until 1819.  Mississippi was admitted as a State on December 10, 1817 with essentially its present boundaries.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Census coverage of present-day Mississippi began in 1800 in the southwestern section close to the Mississippi River.  The populations shown for 1800 and 1810 exclude counties now in Alabama.  The central and northern portions were not fully covered by the census until 1840.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1800 excludes population (1,250) of Washington County, Mississippi Territory, nearly all of which is now in Alabama; total for 1810 excludes population (9,046) of Baldwin, Madison, and Washington Counties, Mississippi Territory, now entirely or mostly in Alabama. Mississippi's present-day Madison and Washington Counties were created in the 1820's.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MISSOURI NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Missouri was acquired as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and became part of Louisiana Territory, established in 1805 and comprising the whole of the Louisiana Purchase north of present-day Louisiana. This was renamed Missouri Territory in 1812.  The southern portion (present-day Arkansas and most of Oklahoma) became Arkansas Territory in 1819.  Missouri was admitted as a State on August 10, 1821; the northwestern corner (the Platte Purchase) was added in 1837, bringing the State to essentially its current boundaries.    ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1810, census coverage of Louisiana Territory was limited to portions of present-day Missouri and Arkansas, mainly close to the Mississippi River. The 1810 census was reported by districts (renamed counties in 1812); Arkansas District was entirely within present-day Arkansas and is shown under that State; New Madrid District also was partly within present-day Arkansas.  In 1820, census coverage of Missouri Territory did not extend beyond present-day Missouri.  After statehood in 1821, Missouri Territory, distinct from the State, continued to exist until 1854, but was almost entirely Indian lands and had virtually no census coverage.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Areas reported in 1810 were districts, renamed counties in 1812. Total for 1810 is population of Louisiana Territory (20,845), excluding population (1,062) of Arkansas District, in present-day Arkansas; total includes New Madrid District, part of which was within present-day Arkansas.  Total for 1890 includes 1 Indian in prison, not reported by county.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MONTANA NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The eastern and central parts of Montana were acquired as early as the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, but had no organized government until Nebraska Territory was established in 1854.  The northwestern part of Montana was included in the newly established Oregon Territory in 1848.  The whole of the present-day State was included in Idaho Territory in 1863, and was established as a separate territory in 1864 with essentially its present boundaries.  Montana was admitted as a State on November 8, 1889.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 1860 census coverage of present-day Montana was limited to two forts enumerated in Nebraska Territory and some settlers in the Bitter Root Valley enumerated in Washington Territory.  In 1870 census coverage included all of the present State.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEBRASKA NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nebraska was acquired as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and became part of Louisiana (later Missouri) Territory.  It was established as a territory in 1854, including extensive areas northwest and west of the present State; it underwent various reductions in area in 1861 and 1863. Nebraska was admitted as a State on March 1, 1867, with nearly its present boundaries.  Its last significant boundary change was the transfer of an area from Dakota Territory in 1882.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Census coverage of Nebraska began in 1860 in the eastern part of the present State.  The 1860 census of Nebraska Territory also included scattered forts and settlements in present-day Wyoming and the Dakotas west of the Missouri River.  Other such settlements in the portion of the Territory included in present-day Montana were reported with Dakota Territory, and those in present-day Colorado were reported with Colorado Territory, although these two territories were not established until 1861.   By 1890, census coverage included the entire State.   For a discussion of possible errors in the 1890 counts for Nebraska, see Edgar Z. Palmer, The Correctness of the 1890 Census of Population for Nebraska Cities (Nebraska History, Vol. XXXII, no. 4, December 1951, pages 259-267).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1860 includes 2,118 persons in areas not organized by county, including Fort Randall (pop. 353) and other scattered forts and settlements in present-day Wyoming and the Dakotas west of the Missouri River.  Total for 1870 includes 235 persons in areas not organized by county; total for 1880 includes 2,913 persons in such areas.  Total for 1890 includes population (3,746) of certain Indian reservations not reported by county.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note 2: Arthur was enumerated with McPherson in 1900-10.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 3: Boyd County was organized in 1891 but reported in 1890; it was formed mainly from territory ceded by South Dakota in 1882 (including most of the area reported as Todd County in 1880), with the remainder from unorganized territory.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NEW MEXICO NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New Mexico was acquired in part in 1845 when Texas joined the United States, and in part directly from Mexico in 1848 and 1853.  New Mexico Territory was established in December 1850, including most of present-day Arizona and parts of Colorado and Nevada.  New Mexico acquired essentially its present boundaries in 1863, and was admitted as a State on January 6, 1912.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1850 census coverage of New Mexico Territory included much of the present State but did not extend beyond it.  The 1860 population refers essentially to the present State; it excludes the then Arizona County, which was located within present-day Arizona, as well as areas that became part of Colorado Territory in 1861.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1860 excludes 6,482 persons in Arizona County, within present-day Arizona.  Total for 1890 includes population (6,689) of certain Indian reservations not reported by county.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 2: Cibola County (1980 pop. 30,347) was formed from Valencia County in 1981.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NORTH DAKOTA NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"North Dakota was admitted as a State on November 2, 1889 with essentially its present boundaries.  It was formed from Dakota Territory, organized in 1861 (for Dakota's earlier history, see the State note for South Dakota).  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1850 census coverage of present-day North Dakota was limited to a few settlements in what was then Minnesota Territory.  In 1860, some forts and settlements in the present State were enumerated in Nebraska Territory as well as in Dakota, which was not yet organized.  No determination has been made to assign the 1860 Dakota total of 4,837 to what became the two separate States.  Census coverage first included the whole State in 1890.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The 1870 and 1880 populations consist of the totals of those counties of Dakota Territory located wholly or primarily in what is now North Dakota, plus (in 1870) an estimated portion of the Territory's unorganized part. The 1890 total includes the population (4,206) of the entire Standing Rock Indian Reservation, much of which was in South Dakota.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Totals for 1870 and 1880 are the totals of those counties of Dakota Territory located wholly or primarily in what is now North Dakota; in addition, the 1870 total includes an estimated share (1,192) of the population of the Territory's unorganized portion (2,091).  Total for 1890 includes the population (8,264) of certain Indian reservations not reported by county; this includes the population (4,206) of the entire Standing Rock Indian Reservation, much of which was in South Dakota.  The 1890 total also includes the population (511) of the Fort Yates and Standing Rock Indian agency other than reservation Indians, likewise not reported by county. Total for 1900 includes the population (2,208) of the portion of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota, not reported by county.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OHIO NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ohio was part of the Territory Northwest of the River Ohio, established in 1787 and commonly known as the Northwest Territory.  Besides present-day Ohio it included what are now Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and northeastern Minnesota.  In 1800, with the creation of Indiana Territory, the Northwest Territory was reduced essentially to present-day Ohio, a small portion of southeastern Indiana, and the eastern half of lower Michigan.  Ohio became a separate territory in 1802 and was admitted as a State on March 1, 1803, with its present boundaries except for a much-disputed strip along the northwestern border. This strip was governed by Michigan Territory until finally ceded to Ohio in 1836.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1790 the Northwest Territory had no census coverage.  The 1800 census enumerated population in much of present-day Ohio and in a portion of southeastern Indiana; the total excludes the then Wayne County, nearly all of whose population was in present-day Michigan.  The 1810, 1820, and 1830 censuses covered all of present-day Ohio except for the disputed northwestern strip, which was enumerated as part of Michigan.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1800 excludes population (3,206) of Wayne County, Northwest Territory, virtually all of which was enumerated in present-day Michigan, but includes part of present-day Indiana in Hamilton County. Total for 1890 includes 13 Indians in prison, not returned by county.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1810 the Ohio portion of its 1800 area was included in many Ohio counties, but it has not been shown as an origin because its Ohio portion was virtually unenumerated in 1800.

OKLAHOMA NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Oklahoma was acquired by the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.  It soon became an area of settlement for various Indian tribes displaced from States farther east, and was known as the Indian Territory although it had various tribal governments rather than a central administration.  Many non-Indians also settled in the area.  Oklahoma Territory was established from a part of the Indian Territory in 1890 and expanded in 1893; the tribal jurisdictions continued in the remainder.  On November 16, 1907 the two parts were admitted as the State of Oklahoma, with substantially the current boundaries.  A dispute about the western boundary was settled in Texas' favor by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1930.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Census coverage did not systematically include any of present-day Oklahoma until 1890; some Indian areas were first enumerated in 1900.  In 1860 non-Indians were enumerated but not included in official population totals; non-Indians in the area in 1870 and 1880 were not enumerated.  The 1890 total is for Oklahoma Territory (78,475) and Indian Territory (180,182);  and the 1900 total is for Oklahoma Territory (398,331) and Indian Territory (392,060).  Just prior to statehood, the U.S. Census Bureau took a special census on July 1, 1907, showing a total population of 1,414,177 (Oklahoma Territory, 733,062; Indian Territory, 681,115); results of this special census are included in the Oklahoma table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Population for 1890 is total of Oklahoma Territory (78,475, including 3,569 non-Indians on Indian reservations but not reported by reservation) and Indian Territory (180,182, including 861 not reported by nation or reservation).  Population for 1900 is total of Oklahoma Territory (398,331) and Indian Territory (392,060).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 2: Population for 1907 is total according to special census of Oklahoma Territory (733,062) and Indian Territory (681,115, including 9,155 not reported by nation or reservation) taken as of July 1, 1907.  The 1907 data are given both for the subdivisions of Indian Territory existing on July 1 and for the counties into which the new State was divided later in that year.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OREGON NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Oregon region was long in dispute with Great Britain, and was jointly occupied by the two countries until definitively acquired by the United States in 1846.  Oregon was established as a territory in 1848, including present-day Washington, Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming.  It acquired its present boundaries and was admitted as a State on February 14, 1859.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In 1850 the census covered only areas west of the Cascade Mountains; the 1850 total excludes persons enumerated in present-day Washington. In 1860 census coverage included the whole State.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1850 excludes population (1,201) of Clark and Lewis Counties, located in present-day Washington.  Total for 1890 includes population (3,937) of certain Indian reservations not reported by county.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SOUTH CAROLINA NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"South Carolina was one of the 13 original States.  By the time of the 1790 census it had essentially its current boundaries, with some later adjustments following improved surveys.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The census has covered all of the State ever since 1790, except for a narrow strip of Indian lands on the northwestern border, first enumerated in 1820.  The 1790 census was not completed in South Carolina until early 1792.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: In 1790 South Carolina was divided into seven districts, two of which were reported by subdivisions termed counties.  The populations of four of the other five districts (Beaufort, Charleston, Georgetown, Orangeburg) are shown in the table in Part III for the counties of the same names; the population of Cheraws District is shown for Marlboro County. For 1800, the populations reported for Chesterfield, Darlington, and Marlboro subdivisions of Cheraw District are shown in the table for the counties of the same names; all three became separate districts by 1810. Otherwise, the populations shown for 1800 through 1860 are those reported for districts; besides Cheraw, a few other districts contained subdivisions called counties, but these are not shown in the table.  All districts were redesignated counties in 1868.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SOUTH DAKOTA NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Most of present-day North and South Dakota was acquired as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, and was included in Louisiana (soon renamed Missouri) Territory.  The part generally west of the Missouri River remained in Missouri Territory until becoming part of Nebraska Territory, formed in 1854.  The portion east of the Missouri because successively  part of Michigan Territory (1834), Wisconsin Territory (1836), Iowa Territory (1838), and Minnesota Territory (1849).  After Minnesota became a State in 1858, this area remained unorganized until Dakota Territory was established in 1861, including all of the present-day Dakotas as well as most of Montana and the northern half of Wyoming.  After 1868 Dakota Territory corresponded to the present two States, plus an area transferred to Nebraska in 1882.  South Dakota (like North Dakota) was admitted as a State on November 2, 1889 with essentially its present boundaries.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Present-day South Dakota had no census coverage in 1850. The population given for 1860 is for the whole of Dakota Territory as organized in 1861, essentially comprising present-day South and North Dakota east of the Missouri River; no determination has been made to assign the 1860 total to what became the two separate States.  In 1860, some forts and settlements in the present State also were enumerated in Nebraska Territory. The 1870 and 1880 populations consist of the totals of those counties of Dakota Territory located wholly or primarily in what is now South Dakota, plus (in 1870) an estimated portion of the Territory's unorganized part. The total population of Dakota Territory was 14,181 in 1870 and 135,177 in 1880.  Considerable portions of the State were not covered by the census until 1900.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain Indian reservations not reported by county in 1880, 1890, or 1900 are shown as separate entries after the counties; only one of these was enumerated in 1880.  Total for 1890 includes 4 Indians in prison, not reported by county or reservation.

TENNESSEE NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Territory South of the Ohio River, formerly part of North Carolina and sometimes known as the Southwest Territory, was created in 1790. It was admitted as the State of Tennessee on June 1, 1796.  Both Territory and State had generally the same boundaries as the present State, except that because of erroneous surveys much of the Tennessee-Kentucky boundary was in dispute for some time; it was not finally resurveyed until 1859. Details of the Tennessee-Virginia boundary were not settled until 1901.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Census coverage in 1790 and 1800 was limited to the northeastern part of Tennessee and the region around Nashville, and coverage did not include the whole State until 1830.  The 1790 census of the Southwest Territory actually began at the end of July 1791.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TEXAS NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Texas was part of Mexico until its revolution in 1835-36 made it an independent republic, with a territory somewhat larger than the present State.  It became part of the United States and was admitted as a State on December 29, 1845.  It reached essentially its present boundaries in 1850, after the sale to the United States of an extensive northwestern area.  In 1896 a long-standing dispute over what is now Greer County, Oklahoma was decided against Texas by the U.S. Supreme Court.  In 1930 a Supreme Court decision transferred from Oklahoma to Texas a narrow strip on the eastern side of the Texas Panhandle.  Beginning in 1905, international treaties and conventions have exchanged small tracts along the Rio Grande with Mexico, notably in and adjacent to the city of El Paso.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Census coverage of eastern Texas began in 1850, although in 1820 and 1830 the census counts for (old) Miller County, Arkansas Territory, included some people in what is now Texas.  By 1880 census coverage included the entire State.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1890 includes 4 Indians in prison, not reported by county, but excludes population (5,338) of Greer County, enumerated as part of Oklahoma although claimed by Texas from 1860 to 1896.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note 2: Aransas County's 1880 census boundaries were virtually the same as those of 1900-90.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 3: Bexar District, an unorganized territory, was formed after 1860; by 1880 its 1870 area was part of Tom Green, Crockett, Martin, Howard, Mitchell, Nolan, Fisher, Scurry, Borden, Dawson, and Gaines.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 4: Cameron, Encinal, Starr, Webb, Zapata: In 1850 Starr and Webb (including areas subsequently in Encinal and Zapata) were reported with Cameron.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note 5: The first Dawson County was formed before 1860 and divided between Kinney and Uvalde in 1866.  The present Dawson County was created in 1876.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 6: Kenedy, Willacy: Kenedy County, formed in 1911, was named Willacy until 1921.  The present Willacy County was formed in 1921 from Cameron and Hidalgo with a small part from Kenedy (old Willacy).  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Note 7: San Patricio's 1860-80 census boundaries were virtually the same as those of 1900-1990.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIRGINIA NOTES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Virginia was one of the 13 original States.  Kentucky was part of Virginia until 1792, and a small part of Virginia was included in the District of Columbia from 1791 to 1846.  West Virginia was separated from Virginia in 1862, becoming a State in 1863 and adding two more counties in 1866. Since then Virginia's boundaries have remained essentially unchanged, with slight modifications as early surveys were reviewed and corrected.  Details of the Virginia-Tennessee boundary were not settled until 1901.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1790 census coverage included all of Virginia's present-day territory; Kentucky was reported separately.  The populations for 1800-1840 include the area that was then part of the District of Columbia, and the populations for 1790-1860 exclude the counties entirely or primarily included in what is now West Virginia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1800 includes 48 persons not credited to any county. Totals for 1790-1860 exclude counties wholly or primarily in what is now West Virginia (1790: 55,873; 1800: 78,592; 1810: 105,469; 1820: 136,808; 1830: 176,924; 1840: 224,537; 1850: 302,313; 1860: 376,688).  The information on county formations specifies (WV) when referring to counties that primarily became part of West Virginia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 2: State totals for 1800-1840 include population of the portion of the District of Columbia taken from Virginia (Fairfax County) in 1791 but retroceded to Virginia in 1846 (1800: 5,949; 1810: 8.852; 1820: 9.703; 1830: 9,573; 1840: 9,967). This area became Alexandria County in 1801; a portion was reported as Alexandria city independent of the county beginning in 1900; Alexandria County was renamed Arlington in 1920.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 3: In Virginia, when a town becomes a city it also becomes independent of its county.  The table lists these independent cities separately after the counties.  Although some cities operated independently of any county much earlier, census publications did not consistently report independent cities as separate from counties until 1890.    Many new independent cities have been created since then, and there also have been numerous annexations from counties to cities.  Several former counties have disappeared through annexation to cities, or through the whole county becoming a city.  In spite of their names, the counties named Charles City, James City, and (until 1952) Elizabeth City are counties, not independent cities. Persons interested in population changes over time often prefer to combine the Virginia independent cities with an adjacent county, to eliminate or reduce the effect of the numerous county/city boundary changes.  The last section of the table gives data for those counties from which a city has been formed or primarily formed, combining populations for the county and the city or cities. Notes for the cities are numbered starting with C1; they specify the county or counties from which the city originally was formed.  In five cases (the cities of Hampton, Newport News, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, and the combined cities of Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Portsmouth) the combined area is listed with the name of a city, as explained in individual notes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WEST VIRGINIA NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"West Virginia was admitted as a State on June 20, 1863, comprising 48 counties formerly part of Virginia; two additional counties, Berkeley and Jefferson, were added in 1866, bringing the State to essentially its present boundaries.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Census coverage included all parts of the present State from 1790 on.  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Populations for 1790-1850 are totals of the Virginia counties that were wholly or primarily within the present-day boundaries of West Virginia; populations at these censuses are not available for the exact present area of the State, because some Virginia counties extended across the current State line.  Population for 1860 is the total of the 50 Virginia counties that formed West Virginia in 1863 and 1866, and does refer to the present area of the State.  The information on county formations specifies (VA) when referring to counties that remained primarily in Virginia.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

WISCONSIN NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Wisconsin was part of the Northwest Territory organized in 1787, then of Indiana Territory (1800).  In 1809 it was included in the new Illinois Territory, except for the northern part of the Door Peninsula, which remained in Indiana Territory.  In 1818 Michigan Territory expanded to include the whole of present-day Wisconsin.  Wisconsin Territory was organized in 1836 and briefly included all of Minnesota and Iowa and the Dakotas east of the Missouri River.  After Iowa Territory was organized in 1838, only northeastern Minnesota, east of the Mississippi River and a line from its source north to the Canadian boundary, remained in Wisconsin Territory. Wisconsin was admitted as a State on May 29, 1848 with essentially its present boundaries.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There was only limited census coverage of the present area of the State prior to 1840.  In 1790 the Northwest Territory had no census coverage. The 1800 census for Indiana Territory reported populations for Green Bay (50) and Prairie du Chien (65); in 1810 any settlers enumerated in these or other Wisconsin communities were reported as part of St. Clair County, Illinois Territory.  In 1820 Crawford and Brown Counties, Michigan Territory, included nearly all of present-day Wisconsin; Crawford also included northeastern Minnesota but this had no census coverage.  This also was the case in 1830, with the addition of Iowa County from part of Crawford.  In 1840 some persons in northeastern Minnesota were enumerated in St. Croix County, Wisconsin Territory.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
County Notes:  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note 1: Total for 1820 is of Brown and Crawford Counties, Michigan Territory; total for 1830 is for these and Iowa County, Michigan Territory; the population enumerated in these counties was within the present boundaries of Wisconsin.

WYOMING NOTES  ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although most of Wyoming was acquired as early as the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, organized government began with the establishment of Oregon, Nebraska, and Utah Territories (1848-54).  Later the area was included in Idaho, Dakota, and Utah Territories until Wyoming Territory was established in 1868 with the present State boundaries.  Wyoming was admitted as a State on July 10, 1890.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1850 and 1860 present-day Wyoming had only limited census coverage, as part of Utah and Nebraska Territories.  In 1870 census coverage included the whole of Wyoming Territory.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
