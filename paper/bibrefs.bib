  abstract={This article puts forward the view that, for each transportation planning or management problem, there is a particular way to simultaneously define the multiple levels of procedures useful for the problem and set it in its proper perspective, the latter essentially by the identification of what is exogenous and endogenous to the problem at hand. The joint determination of these levels and of the exogenous/endogenous mix defines the two-dimensional frame of each problem. To develop our view, we extend our previous conceptual framework to include, in the first dimension, an activity location procedure, and to distinguish, in the second dimension, between operational, tactical, and strategic perspectives. We conclude by relativising the use of solution techniques by making them ancillary to the situation planning requirements.},

title = "Factors influencing light-rail station boardings in the United States",
abstract = "Many US cities have recently built or approved light-rail systems to combat congestion, sprawl, and pollution. Critics questions light rail\{textquoteleft}s ability to generate ridership in low-density, automobile-oriented, polycentric US cities with smaller downtowns. Proponents counter that sufficient numbers of homes and workplaces have convenient access to stations via walking, park-and-ride, or bus to develop feasible corridors connecting major residential areas with suburban concentrations of employment and the CBD. With this in mind, we used multiple regression to determine factors that contribute to higher light-rail ridership. Cross-sectional data on average weekday boardings were collected for the year 2000 for 268 stations in nine US cities representing a variety of urban settings. The results showed the importance of land use and accessibility. Employment, population, and percent renters within walking distance, as well as bus lines, park-and-ride spaces, and centrality, were significant. Dummy variables for terminal and transfer stations and international borders were all positive and significant. Total degree-days were negative and significant, lowering expectations for cities with extreme climates. Notably, the stations in the CBD generate much higher boardings, but these are explainable by the same variables present in lesser combinations at non-CBD stations and account for their generally lesser boardings. Importantly, a dummy variable for CBD location was not significant. The resulting model may be useful as a first-cut, one-step approach for predicting demand for possible light-rail alignments.",

abstract = { The 0.5-mile distance has become accepted for gauging a transit station's catchment area in the United States and is the de facto standard for the planning of U.S. transit-oriented developments (TODs). Planners and researchers use transit catchment areas not only to make predictions about transit ridership and transit impacts (socioeconomic and on land use) but also to prescribe regulations (e.g., relaxing restrictive zoning or carving out TODs for financial plans). This radius is loosely based on the distance that people are willing to walk to transit, but the same reasoning has been used to justify other transit catchment areas. Station-level variables from 1,449 high-capacity American transit stations in 21 cities are used to determine whether a clear benchmark between distance and ridership provides a norm for station-area planning and prediction. Results indicate that, for the purposes of predicting station-level transit ridership, different catchment areas have little influence on a model's predictive power. This finding suggests that transit agencies should use the easiest, most readily available data when estimating direct demand models. The evidence is less clear for prescribing land use policy. Nevertheless, results support the use of a 0.25-mile catchment area around transit for jobs and a 0.5-mile catchment area for population. Even though these distances probably will vary, depending on the location and the study purpose, the distances are good starting points for considering transit-oriented land use policy or collecting labor-intensive data, such as surveys, about transit-adjacent firms or households. }

abstract = {Summary.  We introduce a path following algorithm for L1‐regularized generalized linear models. The L1‐regularization procedure is useful especially because it, in effect, selects variables according to the amount of penalization on the L1‐norm of the coefficients, in a manner that is less greedy than forward selection–backward deletion. The generalized linear model path algorithm efficiently computes solutions along the entire regularization path by using the predictor–corrector method of convex optimization. Selecting the step length of the regularization parameter is critical in controlling the overall accuracy of the paths; we suggest intuitive and flexible strategies for choosing appropriate values. We demonstrate the implementation with several simulated and real data sets.}

abstract="Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",
